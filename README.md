# Easy Contacts 📱👵

**Easy Contacts** is an accessibility-first dialer app designed for the elderly and visually impaired. It reimagines the phone book as a "YouTube Shorts" style vertical carousel—showing one large, high-contrast contact card at a time.

It features **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** announcements when scrolling and a **"Magic Button"** for voice-activated search, reducing the cognitive load of navigating complex lists.

## ✨ Features

* **Vertical "Snap" Interface:** Smooth, 60fps animations using `react-native-reanimated`.
* **Auto-Announce:** Reads the contact name aloud ("Found Sarah") when the card snaps into focus.
* **Magic Voice Search:** A large button to search contacts by voice ("Call Mom").
* **Smart Fallbacks:** Auto-generates high-contrast "Big Letter" posters for contacts without photos.
* **Real Integration:** Fetches actual contacts from the device address book.
* **Direct Actions:** One-tap calling and WhatsApp linking.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React Native (Expo SDK 50+)
* **Animations:** `react-native-reanimated`
* **Navigation:** `react-navigation` (Bottom Tabs)
* **Device Features:** `expo-contacts`, `expo-speech`
